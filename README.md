  <h2 align="center">CZU-MHAD: A multimodal dataset for human action recognition utilizing a depth camera and 10 wearable inertial sensors</h2>

&emsp;&emsp;In order to facilitate the research of multi-modal sensor fusion for human action recognition, this paper provides a multi-modal human action dataset using Kinect depth camera and multile wearable sensors, which is called Changzhou University multi-modal human action dataset (CZU-MHAD). Our dataset contains more wearable sensors, which aims to obtain the position data of human skeleton joints, as well as 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular velocity data of corresponding joints. Our dataset provides time synchronous depth video, skeleton joint position, 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular velocity data to describe a complete human action.

## 1. Sensors

&emsp;&emsp;The CZU-MHAD uses 1 Microsoft Kinect V2 and 10 wearable sensors MPU9250. These two kinds of sensors are widely used, which have the characteristics of low power consumption, low cost and simple operation. In addition, it does not require too much computing power to process the data collected by the two kind sensors in real time.

### 1.1 Kinect v2

&emsp;&emsp;The above picture is the Microsoft Kinect V2, which can collect both color and depth images at a sampling frequency of 30 frames per second. Kinect SDK is a software package provided by Microsoft, which can be used to track 25 skeleton joint points and their 3D spatial positions. You can download the Kinect SDK in `https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561`.

&emsp;&emsp;The above image shows 25 skeleton joint points of the human body that Kinect V2 can track. 

### 1.2 MPU9250

&emsp;&emsp;The MPU9250 can capture 3-axis acceleration, 3-axis angular velocity and 3-axis magnetic intensity. 
- The measurement range of MPU9250: 
  - the measurement range of accelerometer is ±16g;
  - the measurement range of angular velocity of the gyroscope is ±2000 degrees/second. 

&emsp;&emsp;CZU-MHAD uses Raspberry PI to interact with MPU9250 through the integrated circuit bus (IIC) interface, realizing the functions of reading, saving and uploading MPU9250 sensor data to the server.The connection between Raspberry PI and MPU9250 is shown in picture.

## 2. Data Acquisition System Architecture

&emsp;&emsp;This section introduces the data acquisition system of CZU-MHAD dataset. CZU-MHAD uses Kinect V2 sensor to collect depth image and joint position data, and uses MPU9250 sensor to collect 3-axis acceleration data and 3-axis angular velocity data. In order to collect the 3-axis acceleration data and the 3-axis angular velocity data of the whole body, a motion data acquisition system including 10 MPU9250 sensors is built-in this paper. The sampling system architecture is shown in following picture.

<p align="center"> <img src="images/sample.jpg" width=""/></p>

&emsp;&emsp;The MPU9250 sensor is controlled by Raspberry PI, Kinect V2 is controlled by a notebook computer, and time synchronization with a NTP server is carried out every time data is collected. After considering the sampling scheme of MHAD and UTD-MHAD, the position of wearable sensors is determined as shown in the following picture.

&emsp;&emsp;The points marked in red in the figure are the positions of inertial sensors, the left in the figure is the left side of the human body, and the right in the figure is the right side of the human body.

## 3. Information for "CZU-MHAD" dataset.

&emsp;&emsp;The CZU-MHAD dataset contains 22 actions performed by 5 subjects (5 males). Each subject repeated each action >8 times. The CZU-MHAD dataset contains a total of >880 samples. The 22 actions performed are listed in Table. It can be seen that CZU-MHAD includes common gestures (such as Draw fork, Draw circle),daily activities (such as Sur Place, Clap, Bend down), and training actions (such as Left body turning movement, Left lateral movement).

&emsp;&emsp;The subjects marked with '#' also participated in our data collection process. However, due to the unstable power supply and abnormal heat dissipation of Raspberry PI, their behavior data is abnormal. Therefore, we do not provide their data.
